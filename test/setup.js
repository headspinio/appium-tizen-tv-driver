/**
 * Mocha will load this file to configure the environment to use Chai as the
 * assertion library. Since Chai is a singleton, we can run into problems when
 * running files individually, if we have not carefully configured Chai in every
 * single test file. This file means less boilerplate and less random test
 * failures when running single test files.
 *
 * For simplicity, this file is _not_ transpiled.  If it were, Mocha would need
 * to load different versions of this file depending on the test context (are we
 * running tests against the distfiles, or the source files?).

// This configures @babel/register to look for a babel config in parent dir(s) of

// instead of the monorepo root. This does not affect `gulp-mocha`, since it has its own `.babelrc`.
// This file is required _in addition to_ the monorepo root's `test/setup.js`.
